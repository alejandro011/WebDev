    <h1>Data Visualization (part 6)</h1>

    <p>In this part, we're
        going to talk about event handling in D3 and how we can use events to keep
        updated with changes in the code and create interactivity for the user.</p>

    <h2>Event handling in D3</h2>

    <p> In the
        last part, we created a graph model, which calculates the node positions
        dynamically and we also connect these positions to the graphics and the number
        of shapes in our SVGs. Now, if you would look into our example, what you could
        see is that you can't see much. All you can see is little quarter shape on the
        top left of the visualization and if you look into the code of the DOM, you will
        see that all the shapes are present.</p>


    <img src='imgs/events.png' alt="example layout" width=25%/>

    <p> However, they are all located in the
        default position of (0,0) in terms of coordinates, even though the layout is
        calculating new positions constantly. Now, we have connected them, but we are not
        keeping up with the changed position of the layouts. So, what we now need to do is
        we need to take advantage of the events functionality of D3 to tell the shapes
        of our SVG to be updated in terms of position every time our layout is
        calculating a new position for a certain node. This is handled by the tick event
        that is implemented by the force layout.</p>
    
    <img src='imgs/events2.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p>  The force layout in D3 actually
        implements three different events: a start event that is called when the
        event is first started, the tick event is called on every step of the simulation,
        meaning every time a new position is calculated for a node, this tick
        event is called on every node, and finally, an end-event that is called as
        soon as the simulation is stopped. We'll be taking advantage of the tick event for
        now and we will tell the force layout to do something as soon as there is a
        new simulation step completed, and this is something we are going to do.
        </p>

    <img src='imgs/events3.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p>We are are going to take the positions for the nodes, calculated by this layout, and
        attach them to our SVG shapes, so the actual position on our graphic
        gets updated. Now, the position of the node, calculated by the simulation by the
        layout, is stored in an attribute on the data point called x, as you can see
        back here and y.</p>

    <img src='imgs/events4.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p> So, these are the coordinates, calculated by the
        layout. However, SVG uses a different attribute to define the position on the
        SVG graphics. These are called cx and cy.</p>

        <img src='imgs/events5.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p> So, all we need to do now, is we need to
        assign the cx attribute the value of the data point x back here. This is working
        the same way that we used a function to assign the line thickness depending on
        the data in the previous video, and the same thing is working for the link
        down here, except, this time, we have four coordinates: two coordinates for the
        starting point of the line and two for the end point of the line.
         </p>

    <p> And, if we now
        take a look again at our example, you can see there is a nice-looking graph that
        gets updated dynamically as soon as the node positions change in the layout and if
        you want to see this in action and actually move around, please take a look
        at our demo videos.</p>

    <h2>Adding events to nodes</h2>

    <img src='imgs/events-nodes.png' alt="example layout" width=25%/>

    <p> 
        Now, one more thing, we would like to add in this and which is
        also a great example for the use of events is
        some sort of user interactivity, meaning, we can click around the graph, maybe
        drag them around, maybe transform the shape of a graph by clicking around.
        That's why we're going to use the on click event in D3, because SVG elements
        are DOM elements, they do already implement a click event, just like
        buttons or links do in a website.
    </p>

    <img src='imgs/on-click.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p> So, all we have to do now is provide a function
        that will tell to node what it will do if it has been clicked on. Remember here
        that the node selection actually contains every node on our graphic and
        the click event, so, the function we define here, will be called on the node
        that is clicked on. That is why we have to use the 'this' keyword down here to
        select the current node that has been clicked on using D3. So, D3 selects this
        and then we can change any attribute, we can assign new attributes to this node
        itself. In this case, we'll change the radius attribute, meaning the size of the
        circle to 20. In our case, this will increase the size of the node to 20 from
        5 as it was before.</p>

        <img src='imgs/on-click2.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p> If you click on the red node, it will change
        its shape from what you see on the left to what you see on the right. However,
        this would happen instantly. Sometimes, it would be nice to create a smoother
        transition and have a bit of a nicer animation. Luckily, D3 also supports
        animations.</p>

    

    <h2>Adding animations </h2>

    <img src='imgs/animations.png' alt="example layout" width=33%/>

    <p>Of course, it would sometimes be nice to have a bit of a smoother
        transition between the two sizes. This is where animations come in. D3 already
        supports animations. In this case, all we need to do is, before we apply the new
        attribute value, we tell D3 that we wanted animated, they call in the
        transition function and we will also then specify a duration
        for this transition. In this case, we'll use 750 milliseconds. So, if you then go
        back to our example and click on the red node, it will slowly increase its size
        over the course of seven hundred and fifty milliseconds until it stops
        when we have the right configuration. </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
        
        <p>This has shown you how events can be
        used to keep track with internal changes and also provide some interactive
        features. If you would like to know more, see more examples of different events
        that you can implement and get a bit more detail of how it actually works in
        the code, please refer to our demo video.</p>
