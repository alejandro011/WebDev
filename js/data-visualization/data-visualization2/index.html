    <h1>Data Visualization (part 2)</h1>

    <h2>Data visualization with D3</h2>

    <p>In this part, we're going to discuss data visualization. Now, that we have the data retrieved from an API, we will try
        and create a nice-looking graph from the character interactions of the Storm of Swords novel.</p>

    <h2>Why visualization?</h2>

    <p>Technically, all the information that is displayed by visualization is already available in the data itself, but a good
        example for why visualization is important is the so-called Anscombe's quartet.</p>

    <p>You can see it on the left side here. So, what you see is a bunch of data, what you see is that you can't see much at
        first glance. However, luckily, we have some mathematical tools to analyze these four two-dimensional distributions.
        However, in this particular case, if you look at the mean distribution and the distribution means of X, they are
        all exactly the same. The same goes for the variance of the X distribution. And if you look at the Y part of these
        distributions, they are also very similar to at least two percentage points and even more complex things, such as
        a linear regression line are almost identical for all these four distributions. So, you would assume that they follow
        a very similar pattern, that they are even mostly identical. However, as soon as you bring in a visualization of
        these data points, you will notice that they are vastly different and definitely follow different patterns.</p>

    <h2>Visualization on the web</h2>

    <p> So, this is the reason why visualization is vital for data exploration and by now it has become a very common theme to
        use visualization on the web, and for that we use JavaScript, obviously. There are a number of JavaScript libraries
        for web-based data visualization available, such as the ones you can see listed on the left side of the slide. Today,
        we'll be using D3 and we'll talk a little bit about why we will be using D3 in a minute.</p>

    <h3>Three ways to visualize data in the browser</h3>

    <p>First, let's talk about ways in which we can visualize data in the browser in general. Basically, there are three major
        ways.</p>

    <img src='imgs/3ways.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p>The most simple one are HTML elements. They are actually part of the HTML language. That means, they are supported by
        any browser. They support all the things that any HTML element will support. That means DOM-handling and events and
        callbacks would make it really easy to make it responsive and interactive. However, they only support very simple
        shapes, such as circles and lines, and to create more complex shapes, it takes a lot of effort to get it done. Secondly,
        a whole different way of creating graphics in a web page are the Canvas and WebGL elements. Now, Canvas and WebGL
        are different, but these are related, and they work in similar ways. Canvas is for two-dimensional graphics, but
        WebGL enables three-dimensional graphics in a web browser. And if you have a lot of elements and a lot of shapes
        to draw, they are very fast. However, they also require a lot of effort to get it done, because every shape needs
        to be explicitly stated by the user itself. That means that they do not natively support events or callbacks, which
        makes it very hard to create a very nice interactive experience. They also are based on pixels, like a JPEG or a
        bitmap picture, for example, which means that they are a resolution-dependent and if you would like to zoom into
        it, the quality may degrade. The last way to visualize data in the browser is a very common one and these are called
        scalable vector graphics, also known SVG and they are similar in the way they work to HTML elements. They provide
        DOM-handling ability, because they are basically part of the HTML file. That means that you can create events and
        callbacks when clicking on them, which means they are very good for interactive graphs and visualizations. And because
        SVG doesn't actually place any pixels anywhere, but rather provides a description of how a shape should look like,
        it's completely resolution-independent. The problem, however, is that if you have a lot of elements and shapes to
        draw, as in thousands, it can become very slow and we would probably need to move to a WebGL or canvas-based visualization.
        </p>

    <h3>Data driven documents (D3)</h3>

    <p>Let's talk about why we want to use D3. If you go to the website at d3js.org, you will see that most of the examples
        are some form of graph or bar chart, or in some other form of craft-based visualization. However, D3 is not just
        a graphing library, like some of the other ones that we have listed on a few slides ago. It is a more flexible JavaScript
        library.</p>

    <img src='imgs/D3.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p>It is focused on a more abstract concept of binding arbitrary data to a page element and then applying data-driven transformation
        to them. And those can be, for example, SVG graphics. They can also be tables or text elements or any other kind
        of HTML elements. So, the main point for D3 is the way that data binding works with D3 and let's talk about what
        that actually means.</p>

    <h2>Data binding</h2>

    <p>Data binding in web development refers to the assignment of data to specific elements of a UI or, in our case, a website.
        So, for example, imagine we have a star shape that is displayed on our website and that has an attribute that is
        defining its color and we also have a variable in our script that is called star color in this case and it holds
        the color we want the star to have.</p>

    <img src='imgs/data-binding.png' alt="example layout" width=50% />

    <p> We can now assign the variable to the color attribute of the star, so that they are bound together, meaning that if either
        the star color variable in our script changes, for example, programmatically, that will also influence the color
        of the star on the website immediately and vice versa as well. If the star color on the website is, for example,
        through user interaction influenced, this will be reflected in our code and data as well. So, the code and UI are
        kept consistent across changes and D3 uses this as its central working paradigm.</p>

    <h3>Data binding in D3</h3>

    <p>D3 allows the user to bind arbitrary data to the document object model, for example, when providing graph data to create
        an SVG visualization.</p>

    <img src='imgs/data-binding-D3.png' alt="example layout" width=50%/>

    <p> And now, I have already mentioned the document object model or DOM a couple of times. So, in the next part of this course,
        we will talk about what it actually means and will also look into scalable vector graphics before we go on to actually
        create a graph using D3.</p>
