	<h1>Server side Javascript (part 6)</h1>

	<h2>Simple Data Visualization node example</h2>

	<h3>To run:</h3>

	<ol>
		<li>Install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)</li>
		<li>Run `npm install` from within this folder</li>
		<li>Run `node index.js` to start the application and have it run on `localhost:3000`</li>
	</ol>

	<ul>
		<li>In the `config.json` you can change the connection parameters to a mongo instance of your likings.</li>
		<li>The `package.json` defines the application's dependencies, name, description, license, ASO.</li>
		<li>The files in the subfolder `app` represent the logic of the application, the server-side javascript and the views</li>
		<li>The files in the subfolder `public` are available to the frontend and contain style and javascript scripts executed in
			the browser</li>
		<li>The various files in the root (`index.js`, `database.js`, `router.js`) also represent the application's logic in the server-side,
			but are conceputally different than controllers, models or views (thus exist in a different folder) and perform more self-contained
			tasks
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>index.js</h2>

	<img src='imgs/index.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>What we see is that in the very first two lines we have two requirements: the first requirement is express. It's a dependency
		we have just seen it in a package dot JSON and we have just installed it with NPM install. The second thing that we require
		is database and this is actually a file and we see it from this ./ at the beginning of the name. We don't have to specify
		the extension, which in this case is js, as we see here, simply because Node is able to automatically get the extension
		if there is only one file with that name, and we only have one file, which is called database, and the file is either of
		the type JavaScript, so js, or JSON, so dot JSON. And this is exactly the case we only have one file it's called a database
		and it is of the extension dot JavaScript. So, we don't really need to specify the dot and js here.</p>

	<h2>database.js</h2>

	<img src='imgs/database1.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>Again, here, at the very beginning we have two requirements: the second one is just a dependency again, as we have seen
		it before. It is defined in the package.json and the first one is again a file and we see this again from the ./ here and
		it is the config file, but this time a config file is config.json and, as I just explained a few seconds ago, Node is able
		to automatically guess the extension if there is only one file with that name and if that file has either the extension
		dot JavaScript or dot JSON. In our case we only have one file. It's dot JSON. So, we don't need to specify here dot JSON,
		but if we wanted to, we could. Again, it is good practice to see what actually this file contains. So, let's go ahead and
		open config.json.</p>

	<h3>config.json</h3>

	<img src='imgs/config.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>In the config.json we have only one object. We might have an array of objects if, for example, we started our file like
		with brackets [...]. This would then be a JavaScript JSON file with an array of objects. In this case, there's only one
		object inside the array. But, again, the file as it is is only one object, it has one key, which is the database and this
		key has a value associated to it, which is again an object and has a few keys associated to that object. So, when we require
		the config file in database.js, what we actually require is the object in config.json there and we can go ahead and look at our
		database connection string here. And, what we do here is assigning to this database parameters: the config.database
		key. So, we are assigning to this value this constant value - the database object here, so all of the values that we see
		in this object.</p>

	<h3>Construct the database connection string</h3>

	<img src='imgs/database1.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>We then want to construct a database connection string through these lines of code here and what this will perform at the
		end, so what we will get after executing this last line of code, we expect to have something like</p>

	<p>
		<strong>//username:password@example.com:1234/relationships</strong>
	</p>

	<h3>module.exports</h3>

	<img src='imgs/module-exports.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>So, the next important bit we are going to look at is the <b>module.exports</b>. This is an API of Node and it basically tells
		us that when this file is being required by another file, so for example it's being required in index.js, what is actually
		being required is what comes after this equal sign and what we are requiring in this case is a function that accepts a
		callback and that executes some code when the function is being called. </p>
		
		<p>So, let's look at what happens when a function
		is actually being called. The first thing we do is we connect to our database connection string. So, Mongoose connected
		to this connection and then we assign the database object to a variable, which is called db. We then have four events here.
		These are four events and basically what this does is it reacts to certain things that happen onto the database or when
		we connect to the database. <b>First of all, we want to react when there is a connection to the database</b>. So, we are able
		to connect to it and what we want to do is log on to the console that we have been able to connect to the database. The
		next thing that we want to do is <b>to react on this if there was an error</b>. So, if we were not able to connect to the database,
		we want to log this into the console, telling there was some kind of an error. Here is the stack and the next thing we
		want to do is we want to exit our application, because it wouldn't make sense to start our application if we cannot connect
		to the database, as most of the data that we're going to require to answer some routes comes from the database. So, there
		might be some inconsistency if we keep the application running, so we want to exit it. The next thing that we want to do
		is to <b>react on disconnected</b>. So, if we were connected to the database, but then for some mysterious reason the connection
		gets dropped or something like that, again, we want to log this into the console, saying, hey, we've been disconnected
		and we closed our application just because it's safer to do so. Last but not least, is the <b>on open event</b> and this is similar
		to connect, though it's slightly different, because open actually means that we are connected to the database and we are
		able to query the database at the time that this event is happening. So, this is every time the connection is open. <b>So,
		this is the most important event that we have to react on and because of that, this is where we call our callback function
		here. So, again we have the function defined up here as a parameter of our function and we call it when we are fully connected
		to the database. This ensures that when we execute this callback function, we are only executing it when we are sure that
		the database connection is up.</b> </p>

	<h3>What happens when we require the database.js file in index.js</h3>

	<img src='imgs/index.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>So, again we require a <b>database</b> file here and the next place that we see our database variable being used is down here and
		we are using it as a function, because again we exported it. We set <b>module.export</b> and we exported a function, the function
		accepted a <b>callback</b>, which is this anonymous function here and what this tells us is that this function, these lines of
		code that we see here, are only going to be executed when the database connection is up and running when the connection
		is open. So, we are assuring that our application is going to listen to incoming requests only when the database connection
		is open. So, this is very important. Again, because, obviously, we only want to answer to requests once the connection
		to the database is open, because otherwise we have no access to the data and this is exactly what this ensures us.</p>

	<h2>Start the application</h2>

	<p>So, now we can go ahead and start the application</p>

	<img src='imgs/app-start1.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>Or,</p>

	<img src='imgs/app-start2.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p>By running npm start, what we'll see is that it will tell us we are going into node index.js, because that's what we have
		specified in the package dot JSON to be the start of our application. Then, it will log to console that Mongoose has connected,
		which is the event
		<strong>'connected'</strong>
		that we see here </p>

	<img src='imgs/module-exports.png' alt="example layout" />


	<p>And, then, we see these other logs, which stem from the final lines of code in index.js, which tell us ok that we are fully
		connected to the database. </p>

	<img src='imgs/index.png' alt="example layout" />

	<p><b>So, we are executing this callback function and our express server is now listening in our specific port and it is running
		and our application is running and we should be able to open up this website and see some content</b>. So, what we will actually
		do is we will open up the website</p>

	<p>
		<strong>http://localhost:3000/api/relationships</strong>
	</p>

	<p>So, we can copy it, and open up in a web browser and what we will see is all of our JSON objects representing our relationships
		here, which is exactly what we expected from calling that specific route.</p>
