        <h2>What is needed for a web app?</h2>
        
        <p>In this one we're
            going to talk about what is needed for a web application. So, let's start right off
            with the most important part of a web application, which is a request handler. </p>

            <h3>A Request Handler</h3>

            <p>A request handler is something that takes on requests and answers them, and gives
            you the power to answer them in a meaningful way.</p>

            <img src='imgs/request-handling1.png' alt="example layout"/> 

            <p>The first request handler
                that I would like to talk to you about is Express.js. It is de facto
                standard for Node.js. You would hardly ever find anything else, but there are
                alternatives and we just listed another two of them. The first
                alternative is koa, which is a simplified version of Express.js. It
                stems from the same developers as Express.js, but it's a much lighter
                version. Another request handler is Restify. Restify focuses only on
                constructing APIs. So, you would not have views, which we're gonna explain in a
                moment. Restify is also heavily based on Express.js. So, as you see, Express.js
                always comes in.</p>

            <h3>A database</h3>

            <p>The next thing you would probably need when you construct a web
                application is a database. All of the data that you usually see on websites is
                stored in a database and there are two big categories of databases. The first
                category is called relational databases and we see a list of three databases of
                this type in the first line. SQLite, PostgreSQL and MySQL are all
                relational databases and they can be used and are actually used with Node.js.
                But with Node.js it is much more common to use a non-relational database system
                and specifically MongoDB.</p>
        
            <img src='imgs/databases.png' alt="example layout"/>  

            <p>MongoDB allows you to store JSON objects, as we have
                seen them in previous lectures, into a database, which is Mongo. You can then
                retrieve these objects or retrieve only certain fields of these objects. Redis is
                another alternative. Redis is a key-value store, which is now
                again different from MongoDB because you can only store a key. You have a key,
                access this key and you can only store a value by this key. So, for example, if the
                key is age, in my case it would be 23. So, key-value stores are maybe thought for
                smaller applications, but nonetheless you always need a database. MongoDB as well
                as Redis are non-relational databases and if you want to know more about these,
                I invite you to look at the web. There's plenty of guides.</p>

            <h3>A View Engine</h3>

            <p>The last component that
                you might need to build a web application is called a view engine. I
                say might because it's actually not necessary. View engines are only
                necessary if you build a full application with front- and back-end.
                But if you only want to build an API, you won't need a view engine. Here is a list
                of a couple of view engines, which we think you might find interesting.</p>

            <img src='imgs/view-engines1.png' alt="example layout"/>  

            <p>Starting with Angular.js, Angular is important because it's part of something
                called the MEAN stack, which stands for Mongo, Express, Angular and Node. As we
                have seen, Mongo would be the database part of our application, while Express
                would handle every request, incoming and outgoing. Angular would in this case be
                the view engine, while Node is the base of our application. Another popular
                framework is React. It was developed by Facebook and it's widely used. Pug is
                another framework and it's maybe one of the best if you're starting with Node.js.
                This is because it's very similar in syntax to plain HTML. So, if you are used
                to writing HTML files, Pug might be the choice for you. It was previously called
                Jade, but due to some copyright issues, developers had to rename it into Pug. Ember 
                is another choice among small communities of developers.
